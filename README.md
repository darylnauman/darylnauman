# Hello! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Daryl Nauman and I am a full-stack web developer studying at the [University of Toronto School of Continuing Studies](https://bootcamp.learn.utoronto.ca/). I value the connections I have made and continue to make in this field. As I complete my studies I'll be looking for opportunities to apply my skills and make a positive impact. Feel free to reach out.
