# Hello! 👋

My name is Daryl Nauman and welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a full-stack web developer who recently earned a certificate in full-stack web development from the [University of Toronto School of Continuing Studies](https://bootcamp.learn.utoronto.ca/). I have an Executive MBA and previous leadership experience at post-secondary institutions. I am looking forward to joining a team where I can utilize my skills, continue to learn and help advance an organization's goals to make a positive impact. Feel free to contact me.
